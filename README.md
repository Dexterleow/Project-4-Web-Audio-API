### The approach taken:

This project's main focus is to have a more interactive and visually appealing front-end.

There are several features in this app.
Firstly, the logged in user is able to play and remix the available soundtracks. Next, he's able to record his mixtapes and share with all registered users via this site. Finally, he's able to listen to other users' mixed tapes, however he would only be able to delete his own recorded tracks.

Using Web Audio API's analyser, the played music will be rendered and displayed on the page too.

#### Unsolved problems, etc:

Deployed Version:

App has been deployed with Heroku and it's publicly accessibly now. However, this app still have some bugs on the recording feature where the music recorded might not played in sequence at times.
